# Arealis Gateway

A multi-agent autonomous payment processing system with explainable AI and comprehensive audit capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The Arealis Gateway is a sophisticated payment processing platform that leverages multiple specialized agents to handle complex financial workflows with full transparency and compliance.

### Core Agents

- **ACC (Autonomous Compliance Agent)**: Handles regulatory compliance and risk assessment
- **PDR (Payment Decision & Routing Agent)**: Manages payment routing and decision logic
- **ARL (Reconciliation & Ledger Agent)**: Handles transaction reconciliation and ledger management
- **RCA (Root Cause Analysis Agent)**: Performs failure analysis and diagnostics
- **CRRAK (Explainability & Audit Pack Agent)**: Provides explainable AI and audit capabilities

### Cross-Cutting Layers

- **Ingest**: Batch processing and data normalization
- **Security**: RBAC, encryption, and secure key management
- **Intent Router**: Workflow classification and routing
- **Prompt**: LLM interface and RAG capabilities
- **Orchestration**: Ray DAGs and workflow management
- **Memory**: Redis and vector database integration
- **Audit**: Evidence graph and signed pack storage
- **Observability**: Metrics, tracing, and monitoring
